# Neural_Network_from_Scratch

This project was created to explore how a neural network works, including its various components, layers, and functions. This neural netowork was written from scratch, and does not utilize the machine learning framworks Tensorflow or Pytorch. Instead, the libraries Numpy, Pandas, and Random were imported for matrices, data manipulation, and number generation support.
